# The Complete Web Developer Course 2.0

I've bought this course on udemy and it's my start on programing.

I'll commit all my classes and I'm thinking to post on YouTube my improvement.

The challenge is learn to code, studying a hour a day.

EDIT: I'm watching the classes at the work way and praticing at home. I didn't link my GIT to the Visual Studio Code yet. In the first week HTML is done. Now starting the CSS videos.
